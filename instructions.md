# Integrations Engineer Coding Challenge

We want to test your ability to use the Geckoboard product and integrate it with an external API.

To that end, we want you to write a program which:

1. Pulls data from an external API at some sort of regular interval.
2. Pushes that data up to our datasets API (also at a regular interval).

### Outcome

After you've done that, build out some widgets in the Geckoboard app from the dataset and send us:

- the dashboard Sharing link
- your program's code, preferably as a GitHub project
- a description (e.g. README.md) of your project (how it works, your choice of language, platform, tooling etc.), where you are at with it, and if unfinished, the steps you would take to finish the project

### Timing

We know you are busy and we do not want to take up a lot of your time, so if after a few hours of working on this you have not completed the project, please feel free to stop there and send us what you have.

### Favorite flavors

- You can integrate with whatever external API you want.
- Feel free to use whatever language/platform/stack you want to build this.
- Most importantly it should be one that you're comfortable using and explaining your approach for.

### Resources

- You can find documentation for our datasets API here: https://developer.geckoboard.com/
- If you're looking for suggestions, services which Geckoboard already has integrations for are a good start, e.g. Twitter (for a metric like Twitter followers over time) or Mixpanel, Mailchimp, Zendesk, and Pingdom. There is also the Blockchain.info API, and this particular endpoint returns the latest Bitcoin exchange rates for a few popular currencies: https://blockchain.info/ticker which you could use to build a dataset showing the value of Bitcoin over time, and many other variations :slightly_smiling_face:
